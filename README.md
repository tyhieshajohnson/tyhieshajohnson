ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Tyhiesha Johnson, a passionate Software Developer who loves blending tech with creativity.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m always exploring new ways to improve my skills and build impactful projects. Iâ€™m fascinated by the world of marketing, psychology, and human behavior, and I also have a deep curiosity for filming ðŸ¦‹. When I'm not coding, you can find me editing my YouTube videos, spending time in nature or learning something new.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Iâ€™m working with:

Java, Python, JavaScript, Vue.js
MySQL, Node.js
Currently diving into Swift to build some cool iOS apps!
