👋 Hey there! I'm Tyhiesha Johnson, a passionate Software Developer who loves blending tech with creativity.

🚀 I’m always exploring new ways to improve my skills and build impactful projects. I’m fascinated by the world of marketing, psychology, and technology, and I also have a deep curiosity for filming 🦋. When I'm not coding, you can find me editing my YouTube videos, spending time in nature or learning something new.

🔧 Technologies I’m working with:

Java, Python, JavaScript, React.js, React Native, Vue.js
MySQL, Node.js, TailwindCSS, WordPress, Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator

Currently diving into Kotlin to build cool Android apps & Next.js for full-stack web development!

🎨 Always learning about the impact of UI/UX!
