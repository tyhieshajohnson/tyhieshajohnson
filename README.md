ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Tyhiesha Johnson, a passionate Software Developer who loves blending tech with creativity.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m always exploring new ways to improve my skills and build impactful projects. Iâ€™m fascinated by the world of marketing, psychology, and technology, and I also have a deep curiosity for filming ðŸ¦‹. When I'm not coding, you can find me editing my YouTube videos, spending time in nature or learning something new.

Java, Python, PHP, SQL, JavaScript, React.js, React Native, Vue.js, Next.js, Oracle Apex,
MySQL, Node.js, TailwindCSS, WordPress, Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator

Currently diving into Kotlin to build cool Android apps & Next.js for full-stack web development!

ðŸŽ¨ Always learning about the impact of UI/UX!

Letâ€™s code something awesome together! ðŸ’»âœ¨
